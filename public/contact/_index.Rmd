#### I'm most interested in helping:

-   people with ambitious for-purpose projects that aim to change behaviour at scale
-   people trying to figure out what works to solve the world's most pressing problems
-   people trying to synthesise complex secondary data sets
-   prospective students who want to do higher degrees by research (e.g, PhD)

#### I might be able to help you by...

-   translating top-level evidence into behaviour change using evidence-based multimedia design + engaging, effective training programs
-   conducting efficient, effective, and robust systematic reviews / overviews of reviews
-   running sophisticated meta-analytic techniques like network meta-analysis or <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaSEM/vignettes/Examples.html">meta-analytic structural equation models</a>
