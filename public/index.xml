      <description>As a teacher at a university, there are hundreds of little decisions that add up to a radically different student experience. You need to choose learning objectives, choose assessments, choose learning activities, and choose how to present content.
INSPIRE is fundamentally about helping you to choose the best teaching strategies&amp;mdash;to choose the ones that work, rather than the ones that don&amp;rsquo;t. You can see a summary of the project and our pilot website here: INSPIRE your students with evidence-based teaching.</description>

A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PhD Thesis</title>
      <link>https://noetel.com.au/projects/work1/</link>

      <description>My thesis looked at the effects of mindfulness in sport and performance settings. It included:
 a systematic review of studies that explore mindfulness in athletes; machine learning methods for making short questionnaires, with a mindfulness case study; and a double-blinded randomised experiment that tested a brief mindfulness induction in athletes  Ultimately, I think the key lessons were that mindfulness isn&amp;rsquo;t the panacea that many make it out to be.</description>
