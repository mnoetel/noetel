      <description>As a teacher at a university, there are hundreds of little decisions that add up to a radically different student experience. You need to choose learning objectives, choose assessments, choose learning activities, and choose how to present content.
INSPIRE is fundamentally about helping you to choose the best teaching strategies&amp;mdash;to choose the ones that work, rather than the ones that don&amp;rsquo;t. You can see a summary of the project and our pilot website here: INSPIRE your students with evidence-based teaching.</description>

      <description>I am interested in questions that focus on impartially improving welfare. I am increasingly focused on research that is important, neglected, and tractable, with a long-term view of the future. As a result I am:
  a founding member of READI Research which created project including
  What works to increase charitable donations? A meta-review with meta-meta-analysis
  Interventions that Influence Animal-Product Consumption: A Meta-Review

      <description>Systematic reviews are the core of evidence-informed decision-making. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed expertise in all parts of conducting a range of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-reviews (a.k.a., overviews of reviews). These have manifest in a range of high-impact publications:
 Video Improves Learning In Higher Education: A Systematic Review. Review of Educational Research. Impact Factor: 8.241 School-Based Interventions Modestly Increase Physical Activity And Cardiorespiratory Fitness But Are Least Effective For Youth Who Need Them Most: An Individual Participant Pooled Analysis of 20 Controlled Trials.</description>

      <description>I think there&amp;rsquo;s so much wisdom trapped in universities. Often, getting that knowledge out into practice can save lives. For why I think this is important, see this pitch I made to our university in 2021:
Many of my projects have been about translating academic knowledge into practice. By using my skills in online learning, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to help those projects have impact cost-effectively and at scale. For example:</description>

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 a systematic review of studies that explore mindfulness in athletes; machine learning methods for making short questionnaires, with a mindfulness case study; and a double-blinded randomised experiment that tested a brief mindfulness induction in athletes  Ultimately, I think the key lessons were that mindfulness isn&amp;rsquo;t the panacea that many make it out to be.</description>
