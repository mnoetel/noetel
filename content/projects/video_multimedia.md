Multimedia is the lingua franca of modern education. I've published [meta-analyses showing it's a great way of teaching, especially at scale](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0034654321990713). Most of my [knowledge translations projects](https://noetel.com.au/projects/knowledge_translation/) have heavily leveraged video and multimedia. I have 'full-stack' video production skills from scripting, co-ordination, videography, graphics, and editing.<!--more-->
