I think there's so much wisdom trapped in universities. Often, getting that knowledge out into practice can save lives.<!--more-->

*This is a pitch [I made to our university in 2021](https://youtu.be/Qvfz-OcgF3E) for why I think knowledge translation is so important*

Many of my projects have been about translating academic knowledge into practice. By using my skills in online learning, I've been able to help those projects have impact cost-effectively and at scale. For example:

1.  [iPLAY](https://iplay.org.au/) is a whole-of-school blended learning intervention that improved children's fitness for \$16AUD/year and has been rolled out to \~200 schools. This project has been awarded both:

    1.  Excellence and Innovation in Public Health Education and Research (Team Award)**  
        ***Council of Academic Public Health Institutions Australasia*

    2.  Vice-Chancellor's Staff Excellence Award: Excellence in Research & Research Partnership**  
        ***Australian Catholic University*

2.  [Burn2Learn](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/12/20/bjsports-2020-103277) improved adolescent fitness, muscular strength, physical activity, and cortisol with school-based high-intensity interval training

3.  [Thinking While Moving in English](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-18509/v1) improved on-task behaviour, grammar and punctuation by improving physically active English lessons

4.  [Ahead of the Game](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2021/01000/An_Intervention_for_Mental_Health_Literacy_and.17.aspx) improved [resilience, well-being and mental health literacy](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2021/01000/An_Intervention_for_Mental_Health_Literacy_and.17.aspx) with a blended learning intervention targeting adolescent athletes. It's now been scaled up as part of [the national suicide prevention effort](https://aheadofthegame.org.au/)

In all of these projects, I was responsible for the multimedia and online learning at the core of the intervention. Here's a summary of the key approaches I used:
