I am interested in questions that focus on [impartially improving welfare](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#impartial-concern). I am increasingly focused on research that is [important, neglected, and tractable](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/importance-neglectedness-tractability/), with a [long-term view of the future](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#longtermism).

I am interested in both research aligned with the principles above and community engagement that tries to have the biggest [marginal impact](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#expected-value-and-counterfactuals) on the welfare of others. If you are too, let's [get in touch](https://noetel.com.au/contact/).
