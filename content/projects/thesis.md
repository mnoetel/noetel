My thesis looked at the effects of mindfulness in sport and performance settings. It included:

1.  a [systematic review of studies that explore mindfulness in athletes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1750984X.2017.1387803);
2.  [machine learning methods for making short questionnaires](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1469029218306757), with a mindfulness case study; and
3.  [a double-blinded randomised experiment that tested a brief mindfulness induction in athletes](https://psyarxiv.com/8bk7m/)

Ultimately, I think the key lessons were that mindfulness isn't the panacea that many make it out to be. The research is developing but overall, pretty low quality. It's a low cost and moderate reward string in the bow of a high-performer, but can't be relied upon as a silver bullet.
