## Our Approach to Making Good Teaching Decisions

As a teacher at a university, there are hundreds of little decisions that add up to a radically different student experience. You need to choose learning objectives, choose assessments, choose learning activities, and choose how to present content.

INSPIRE is fundamentally about helping you to choose the best teaching strategies---to choose the ones that work, rather than the ones that don't. You can see a summary of the project and our pilot website [here: INSPIRE your students with evidence-based teaching.](https://www.notion.so/inspireprogram/INSPIRE-7f7d944e6ccd4d0691231b1984e9d7fa)
