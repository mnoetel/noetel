Systematic reviews are the core of [evidence-informed decision-making](https://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/assets/Science-of-Using-Science-Final-Report-2016.pdf). I've developed expertise in all parts of conducting a range of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-reviews (a.k.a., overviews of reviews). These have manifest in a range of high-impact publications:
