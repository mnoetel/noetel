    - I'm an academic, performance psychologist, and effective altruist. I want to work toward solving the world's most pressing problems using evidence-synthesis, knowledge translation, and behaviour change. Basically, I want to help people making important decisions use the best evidence to change behaviour. See my <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=RAe4W2QAAAAJ">publications here</a>.
    - Originally from Sydney but fell in love with a Queenslander. Proud dad of a little T-Rex.
